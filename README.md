# US-Accidents-EDA

## ***Goal of the Project:*** ðŸ“ƒ
The goal of this project is to investigate various attributes and trends on temperature, weather condition, traffic signals that affect the accidents occuring.The data is  collected from 49 states of the United States of America over the period between February 2016 and December 2020. 

## Dataset:-
The dataset used for the project is [US Accident Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents). 

- Datasize: ~3M entries
- Time period: February 2016 to December 2019
- Scope: 49 US states

## ***Steps Followed*** :pen:

1. Selected a large dataset from Kaggle.

2. Performed data preparation and Cleaning using Numpy and Pandas.

3. Performed EDA and Visulization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

4. Ask and answer question on the data

5. Summarize the inferences.

## Data Cleaning:
- Select important features and remove unnecessary columns.
- Remove the rows with null values.
- Do data profiling to validate correctness of data.

## Data Preprocessing:
- Convert columns with text field to numerical data.
- Categorized weather conditions
- Eliminated rows that greatly contributed to the imbalance of the data and were not significant in volume
- Replaced null values with fillers

### Data Overview:-
#### We will first discuss about each attribute and discuss what it stands for:
- ID:- A unique identifier for each accident.
- Source:- The source which reported the accident.
- TMC:- It is Traffic Messagen Channel which providea more detailed description of the event.
- Severity:- The level of impact of the accident. 1 being the lowest and 4 being the highest.
- Start_Time:- Shows start time of the accident in local time zone.
- End_Time:- Shows end time of the accident in local time zone.
- Start_Lat:- Shows latitude in GPS coordinate of the start point.
- Start_Lng:- Shows longitude in GPS coordinate of the start point.
- End_Lat:- Shows latitude in GPS coordinate of the end point.
- End_Lng:- Shows longitude in GPS coordinate of the end point.
- Distance(mi)-: The length of the road extent affected by the accident.
